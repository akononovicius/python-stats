# Python stats

A collection of various functions that
[I use in my Econophysics research](http://kononovicius.lt).
Usually these functions are/will be built upon the available functions (in
vanilla Python or common libraries), but contain specific additions relevant
to my research.

E.g., one of the libraries contains functions used to extract
burst statistics as described in my paper with Gontis and Reimann [V. Gontis,
A. Kononovicius, S. Reimann. *The class of nonlinear stochastic models as a
background for the bursty behavior in financial markets*. Advances in Complex
Systems **15** (supp01): 1250071 (2012). doi: 10.1142/S0219525912500713.
arXiv: 1201.3083 [q-fin.ST].]. While another library contains an implementation
of MF-DFA algorithm (which I wasn't able to find in any common Python library).

This repository is meant as a storage for the most recent versions of the
stats libraries for myself. If it is useful to anyone else, feel free to
use the code (under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/)). Though you might want to
check out [my papers](http://kononovicius.lt) as you might also find something
of interest there.
